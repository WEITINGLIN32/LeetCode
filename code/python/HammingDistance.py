Title: 461. Hamming Distance (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/

Runtime: 20 ms, faster than 77.98% of Python online submissions for Hamming Distance.
Memory Usage: 11.7 MB, less than 5.53% of Python online submissions for Hamming Distance.

Description:
        The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
        Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Example:
    Input: x = 1, y = 4

    Output: 2

    Explanation:
    1   (0 0 0 1)
    4   (0 1 0 0)
           â†‘   â†‘

    The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
